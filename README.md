# $$PyChain-Ledger$$

In this repo I created a very simple blockchain [web application](https://olegreg762-pychain-ledger-pychain-7xvm6y.streamlit.app/), [pychain.py](/pychain.py).  This was done using the streamlit python library. <br>
Streamlit is a libray used to create web applications with the user only needing python.<br>
Using python and streamlit the simple blockchain application will allow you to create and store transaction data.<br>
