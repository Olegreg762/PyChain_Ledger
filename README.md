## Genesis Block<br>

In this repo I created a very simple blockchain web application [pychain file](/pychain.py). This was done using the streamlit pythin library. <br>
Streamlit is a libray used to create web applications with the user only needing python.<br>
Using python and streamlit the simple blockchain application will allow you to create and store transaction data.<br>
 <br>
