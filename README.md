# $$PyChain-Ledger$$

In this repo I created a very simple blockchain web application [pychain.py](/pychain.py). This was done using the streamlit python library. <br>
Streamlit is a libray used to create web applications with the user only needing python.<br>
Using python and streamlit the simple blockchain application will allow you to create and store transaction data.<br>

The application can be run in 2 ways.
1. In terminal type `streamlit run paychain.py`
2. Use the hosted [web application](https://olegreg762-pychain-ledger-pychain-6sothb.streamlit.app/)
